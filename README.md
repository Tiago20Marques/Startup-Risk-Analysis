# Startup Risk Analysis

Tools Used: Excel Â· Python (Jupyter Notebook) Â· SQL Â· Power BI

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes the risk levels of startups across different sectors and regions.
It demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics process from raw data to actionable insights, using multiple tools for cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

---

## ðŸ“Š Objectives
- Build a weighted risk scoring model combining cost estimates, industry data, and operational metrics to classify startups into five risk categories
- Explore sectoral and geographical risk patterns
- Provide actionable insights for investors and stakeholders

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills
- **Excel**: Initial data exploration, creating new calculated columns to enhance dataset usability and support later analysis
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**: Data cleaning & visual exploration
- **SQL**: Data preprocessing & transformations
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard & storytelling

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights from the Startup Risk Analysis
- **Risk Distribution**

The majority of startups fall into the Medium Risk and High Risk categories, suggesting that while extreme risk exists, most operate within a moderate risk band.
Only 13% are in the Very High Risk category â€” but these often cluster in certain industries and regions.

- **High-Risk Concentrations**

Industries such as AI, EdTech and Gaming have higher average risk scores compared to others.

- **Regional Risk Patterns**

Regions like South America have a disproportionately high percentage of High and Very High Risk startups.
Some regions, like Asia maintain consistently low risk, potentially due to stronger ecosystems or better funding support.

- **Impact of Age on Risk**

Younger startups (< 4 years) are generally higher risk, but thereâ€™s a noticeable dip in risk between 9â€“15 years, after which the risk stabilizes or slightly increases (possibly due to market saturation or scaling challenges).

- **Industry Leaders vs. Stragglers**

The least risky industries include E-Commerce and CyberSecurity, where costs are lower and scaling is more controlled.
The risk gap between industries shows potential for targeted investment strategies.
